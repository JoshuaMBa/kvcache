DISCUSSION
This wasn't too difficult, I mostly focused on just running the integration tests.
I think my biggest difficulty was in understanding how the lab infrastructure worked
so that I could come up with a strategy to implement test for GetShardContents. But
I think I ultimately came up with a pretty effective series of tests, which I described
and coded with the help of ChatGPT. I'm particularly interested in the distribution test,
which we haven't had a chance to run because we have yet to implement it.
